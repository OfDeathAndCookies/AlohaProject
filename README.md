#Aloha Co. Project

This is my first responsive website project for AlohaCo. an apparel website. 

## Getting Started

Go to: https://nosapaath.github.io/AlohaProject/
Feel free to use VsCode or any other editor to play around with my code.  


### Instructions

1. Soft scrolling at the nav options. Feel free to click on the ABOUT, SHOP, FEATURED, and UPDATES. 
2. Notice when scrolling down the navigation is fixed at the top. 
3. To test the responsiveness of the website, please feel free to view AlohaCo also using your phone/tablet/Desktop (not designed for smart watch screen sizes)
4. An alert should show when you enter your email and press on subscribe. 
5. When you are on the featured list, clicking on "Add to cart" button will activate a counter next to the cart icon (top right) and counts your clicks on the button. 
6. Navigate to our contact info at the bottom of the screen and if you click on our email, it should launch your favourite email application with our email as a recipient.
